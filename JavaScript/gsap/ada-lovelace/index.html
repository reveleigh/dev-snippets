            <h2>The Enchantress of Number</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers.</p>
