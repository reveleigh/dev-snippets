# Using a slide switch

This example demonstrates how to use a slide switch with a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The slide switch is connected to the Pico W using a breadboard. The Pico W is running a simple Python script that listens for messages from Node-RED and turns a corresponding switch on and off in the Node-RED dashboard.
