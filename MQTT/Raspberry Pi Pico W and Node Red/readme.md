## Using The Raspberry Pi with Node-RED and MQTT

Here I am documenting my learning around Node-RED and MQTT.

I have set up a Raspberry Pi as a MQTT broker and connected it to my home network. Currently, I have Node-RED running on my laptop for these experiments.

I am using it along with a Raspberry Pi Pico W to control various input and output devices. These examples are found in the sub-folders of this directory.
