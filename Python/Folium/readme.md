# Folium experiments

I am beginning to experiment with Folium, a Python library that allows you to create interactive maps. This is a simple example of how to lay triangles over a map.

## Installation

You'll first need to install the Folium library. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install folium
```

The get_coordinates.py file will generate the vertices of an equalateral triangle given one of the vertices as an input - and assumes that 1 degree of longitude is equal to 45 miles on the ground (which is roughly the case here in Gloucestershire).
