# Folium experiments

I am beginning to experiment with Folium, a Python library that allows you to create interactive maps. This is a simple example of how to lay triangles over a map.

## Installation

You'll first need to install the Folium library. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install folium
```

The get_coordinates.py file will generate the vertices of an equalateral triangle given one of the vertices as an input - and assumes that 1 degree of longitude is equal to 45 miles on the ground (which is roughly the case here in Gloucestershire).

## Generating triangles

The generate_triangles.py file will generate a series of triangles over a map of Gloucestershire (but you can put in any latitude and longitude starting point.) The triangles are generated by taking a single point and then generating the other two points of the triangle.

Pass in depth and distance as a parameter to generate a series of triangles.

## Displaying the map

The folium-example.py file will display the map with the triangles overlaid.

```bash

```
