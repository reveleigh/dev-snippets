  Table 1 Header Candidate: ['Key Concepts: (Threshold Concepts) State the big ideas or skills that students will revisit throughout the curriculum', 'The Curriculum is sequenced by Chronology. An ability to develop a sense of historical period is significant in helping students to understand how society has changed over time. The importance of religion, social hierarchy, systems of power and economic development are key concepts students will revisit throughout. Developing technological advances will also thread through topics, helping students to understand how the people from different cultures and civilisations connect; and why warfare, science and economies improve. Throughout all lessons, the following second-order historical concepts are explored and developed: Significance, Causation, Consequence, Change, Continuity, Diversity. Students are also exposed to, and expected to analyse and evaluate, a range of historical sources and interpretations.']
